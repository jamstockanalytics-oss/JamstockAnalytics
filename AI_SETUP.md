### 5. Fallback Behavior

If the AI API is not configured or fails:

- News articles will display sample data
- All features remain functional with mock data

### 6. Development vs Production

- **Development**: Uses fallback responses when API key is missing
- **Production**: Requires valid DeepSeek API key for full functionality

### 7. Cost Considerations

- DeepSeek offers competitive pricing
- Monitor usage through their dashboard
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

### 8. Security Notes

- API key is exposed to client (use EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix)
- Consider implementing server-side proxy for production
- Monitor API usage and implement safeguards

## Next Steps

1. Get your DeepSeek API key
2. Add it to your `.env` file
3. Restart the development server
4. Test AI features in the app

The AI integration is designed to enhance user experience while maintaining app functionality even without AI services.
