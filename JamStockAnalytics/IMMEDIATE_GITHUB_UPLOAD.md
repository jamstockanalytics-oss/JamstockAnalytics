2. Click **New repository secret** and add these:

```

```

### Step 5: Test the Automated Build System

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click **Automated Build and Deploy**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Choose:
   - Build profile: `automated`
   - Platforms: `all`
5. Click **Run workflow**
6. Watch the build progress!

## ðŸ”¥ Quick Upload Checklist

- [ ] Repository created/accessed
- [ ] All files uploaded via drag & drop
- [ ] Commit message added
- [ ] Files committed to main branch
- [ ] GitHub secrets configured
- [ ] Workflow triggered manually
- [ ] Build progress monitored

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After successful upload and configuration:
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow will be active
- âœ… Automated builds will run for Android, iOS, and Web
- âœ… Database setup will be automated
- âœ… Tests will run automatically
- âœ… Deployment will happen automatically

## ðŸ†˜ If Upload Fails

**If drag & drop doesn't work:**
1. Try uploading files in smaller batches
2. Upload folders one by one
3. Use GitHub Desktop (download from desktop.github.com)

**If files are too large:**
1. Check if `node_modules` is included (it shouldn't be)
2. Create `.gitignore` file with:
   ```
   node_modules/
   .env
   dist/
   build/
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- All files appear in your GitHub repository
- GitHub Actions tab shows the workflow
- Manual workflow run completes successfully
- Build logs show no errors
- All platforms build successfully

**DO THIS NOW!** Your automated build system is ready to be deployed to GitHub!
